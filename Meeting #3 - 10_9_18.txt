Meeting Notes:
This was a longer meeting, during which we spent the majority of the time doing two tasks:
1) Developing our Zoho account for project managment
2) Completing the tasks for Milestone #2

Everyone has been added to the Zoho page, and we are becoming more familiar with it.

Progress:
-Two raspberryPi devices have been purchased and we will start to program them soon.
-We have narrowed the scope of our project a bit

We did a stand-up meeting for our sprint.

More details on all of the above are located within the milestone #2 pdf document, in the "Milestone" repo
