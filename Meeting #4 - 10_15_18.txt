Meeting Notes:
We learned how to host a website on our local computers as servers (thanks David) and set up a code folder for the "Frontend" code documents
Our Zoho account was further developed, and we finished setting up all the tasks necessary for the first 3 sprints.
We distributed tasks for the week, which mainly included watching some tutorials on React and installing web service applications on David's servers, so we have a place to host our website.
